# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The dataset contains direct marketing campaign data of a banking institute. It contains 20 features such as job,age, marital status etc.
The target column contains categories as "yes"/ "no", to determine whether the client subscribed to the bank's term deposit.

In this project I first created the compute to run my python code -

Tuned the hyperparameters of the LogisticRegression model using Hyperdrive achieving an accuracy of ~91%

Using AutoML I could find the best algorithm & got an accuracy of 91.70% for **VotingEnsemble**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
The step by step approach is 
- Reading data from csv
- Training logistic regression model
- Leveraging HyperParameter tuning to identify optimal parameters that perform with great accuracy on this dataset

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
- The benifit of using Parameter Sampler is by using Random sampling I can have discrete & continuous hyperparameters. It also supports early termination &  values are randomly selected from the defined search space.
- 
**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**
  Early stopping is a good way so as to effectively use resources & stop when you see no imporvements

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
Automl tries various models internally & able to identify good models

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**
Clearly visible improvement in accuracy

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
I think few improvemnts or things I would do is analysing dataset more & dientifying if I can create new features & also see if I can get more data 
Also keep sepearate test data & see if evaluation gives better results , make sure my model is not overfitting

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
**Image of cluster marked for deletion**
I deleted the cluster , PFA image
